dbpedia-links
=============

A repo that contains outgoing links in ntriples format

Usage
=====
Please improve the links and add new files and then do a pull request.  Data will be loaded into the DBpedia endpoint in the future. 
We don't know at which point in the future this will happen. We also plan to update links in http://live.dbpedia.org on a weekly basis. 

Conventions / Rules
===================
1. All nt files are alphabetically sorted and there are not duplicate triples in accordance with the Unix command: sort -u . Please honor this convention for better diffs. 
2. There will be some quality control; not everybody will be able to include any links he wants to include. We are open to ideas how to manage this. Consider "pull requests" as "application for inclusion"

Feedback
========
goes (as always) to the DBpedia Discussion mailinglist: https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dbpedia-discussion
